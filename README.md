# LabProj_2022_SudiamoTogether

MESSAGE TO ALL THE GROUP MEMBERS:

This very simple repository is a tester for lab activities in Software and Computing for Applied Physics. Unfortunately I do not know how much time I will be able to spend at daytime on all of this, but feel free to modify, add and comment anything you like :) 

Wish you the very best, remember that in any case:
